# AI Agent Guide for RuboCop

RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer and formatter.
Before contributing, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[development docs](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/development.html).

## Essential Commands

```bash
bundle exec rake              # Full CI: codespell + doc syntax check + specs + self-lint
bundle exec rake spec         # Run specs (Parser)
bundle exec rake prism_spec   # Run specs (Prism parser)
bundle exec rake internal_investigation  # RuboCop linting itself
bundle exec rubocop --only Department/CopName  # Lint with a single cop
```

Always run `bundle exec rake` before opening a PR.

## Project Layout

```
lib/rubocop/cop/<department>/<cop_name>.rb   # Cop source
spec/rubocop/cop/<department>/<cop_name>_spec.rb  # Cop spec
config/default.yml                           # Default configuration for every cop
changelog/                                   # Pending changelog entries (one per file)
lib/rubocop/cop/<department>.rb              # Department module with `register_cop` directives for lazy loading (auto-updated by generator)
```

Departments: `Bundler`, `Gemspec`, `Layout`, `Lint`, `Metrics`, `Migration`,
`Naming`, `Security`, `Style`, `InternalAffairs`.

## Creating a New Cop

Scaffold:

```bash
bundle exec rake 'new_cop[Department/CopName]'
```

This generates the source file, spec file, `config/default.yml` entry, and
a `register_cop` directive in the department module (`lib/rubocop/cop/<department>.rb`),
which registers the cop for lazy loading. After generation:

1. Update the description in `config/default.yml`.
2. Implement the cop.
3. Write specs.
4. Add a changelog entry: `bundle exec rake changelog:new`.

### Cop Class Structure

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module RuboCop
  module Cop
    module Style
      # One-line summary starting with a verb (e.g. "Checks for …", "Enforces …").
      # Additional detail paragraph(s) if needed.
      #
      # @safety
      #   Explain why autocorrect may be unsafe, or delete this section.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad
      #   bad_code
      #
      #   # good
      #   good_code
      #
      class MyCop < Base
        extend AutoCorrector

        MSG = 'Use `#good_method` instead of `#bad_method`.'
        RESTRICT_ON_SEND = %i[bad_method].freeze

        # @!method bad_method?(node)
        def_node_matcher :bad_method?, <<~PATTERN
          (send nil? :bad_method ...)
        PATTERN

        def on_send(node)
          return unless bad_method?(node)

          add_offense(node) do |corrector|
            corrector.replace(node, 'good_method')
          end
        end
        alias on_csend on_send
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Key conventions:

- **`RESTRICT_ON_SEND`** — list method names so `on_send` is only called for
  those methods (performance optimization). Required when using `on_send`.
- **`alias on_csend on_send`** — handle safe navigation (`&.`). Add this
  whenever you define `on_send`, unless the cop explicitly does not apply to
  safe navigation.
- **`alias on_numblock on_block`** and **`alias on_itblock on_block`** — handle
  numbered-parameter blocks (`_1`) and `it`-blocks. Add these whenever you
  define `on_block`.
- **`extend AutoCorrector`** — declare this when the cop provides autocorrect.
- **`def_node_matcher`** / **`def_node_search`** — DSL for AST pattern matching.
  Document with a `@!method` YARD tag above each matcher.
- **YARD `@example`** — every cop must have at least one `# bad` / `# good`
  example pair. Examples must be **valid Ruby syntax** (the CI doc-syntax check
  parses them).
- **Cop description** — the first line of the YARD comment must be a complete
  sentence starting with a verb and ending with a period.
- **Method definition order**: define methods in the order they are called,
  so a new method is placed where the call flow reaches it.

## Preview: Shipping Unstable Behavior

`AllCops: Preview` (or `--preview`) is the opt-in channel for changes that are
not ready to be the default. Cops read it via `preview?`.

Use it when:

- **A cop's default should change in the next major release** (its `Enabled`
  state, a `Max` threshold, an `EnforcedStyle`). Add a `Preview` section to the
  cop's entry in `config/default.yml` with the new values. `AllCops` can carry
  one too. This needs no code:
  the configuration loader applies the section under preview and drops it
  otherwise. This is the most common case.
- **An existing cop should start reporting a case it currently misses**, and the
  change is contested enough that turning it on for everyone would be rude.
  Without preview this waits for a major release.
- **An existing cop should correct something differently**, and the new
  correction needs real-world exposure before it becomes the default.
- **A new cop is too speculative even for `pending`**, so it ships as
  `Enabled: preview` in `config/default.yml`. It is opt-in only and, unlike a
  pending cop, is never reported as needing a decision.

Do **not** use it when:

- The change is a plain bug fix. Those just ship.
- The cop is new and you already expect it to be on by default eventually. That
  is what `Enabled: pending` is for.

The rule of thumb: if you already know it should become the default, it is
`pending`. If you are asking users to help you find out, it is `preview`.

```yaml
# config/default.yml: a default change, no code needed
Style/Documentation:
  Enabled: true
  Preview:
    Enabled: false
```

```ruby
# a behavior change inside a cop
def on_send(node)
  return unless offense?(node)
  return if node.csend_type? && !preview?

  add_offense(node)
end
```

Cover both paths in specs, since the stable one is what most users run:

```ruby
context 'when preview is enabled' do
  let(:all_cops_config) { super().merge('Preview' => true) }

  it 'registers an offense for the safe-navigation form' do
    # ...
  end
end
```

Preview behavior is unstable by contract: it can change or be withdrawn in any
release. See `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/versioning.adoc` for the lifecycle.

## Severity

A cop's default severity comes from its department, via `DEPARTMENT_SEVERITIES`
in `Cop::Base`: `Lint` and `Security` report as `warning`, `Metrics` as
`refactor`, everything else as `convention`. Do not add `Severity:` to a cop in
`config/default.yml` unless it genuinely differs from its department;
`spec/project_spec.rb` rejects a line that restates the default. The few
existing exceptions are lint-like cops in mixed departments
(`Bundler/InsecureProtocolSource`) and the three `Layout` alignment cops that
used to live in `Lint`.

`AllCops: FailLevel` (default `refactor`) is the lowest severity that fails a
run; `--fail-level` overrides it. Under `Preview` it is `warning`.

## Writing Specs

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

RSpec.describe RuboCop::Cop::Style::MyCop, :config do
  it 'registers an offense when using `#bad_method`' do
    expect_offense(<<~RUBY)
      bad_method(foo)
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Use `#good_method` instead of `#bad_method`.
    RUBY

    expect_correction(<<~RUBY)
      good_method(foo)
    RUBY
  end

  it 'does not register an offense when using `#good_method`' do
    expect_no_offenses(<<~RUBY)
      good_method(foo)
    RUBY
  end
end
```

- **`expect_offense`** — `^` carets mark the offense range and must align
  exactly under the offending code. The message follows the last caret.
- **`expect_correction`** — expected source after autocorrect. Must follow
  `expect_offense` in the same example.
- **`expect_no_offenses`** — assert no violations.
- Use `%{variable}` in `expect_offense` heredocs to interpolate dynamic values.
- Use `_{variable}` for offense-range placeholders.
- Use RSpec metadata tags like `:ruby27`, `:ruby34` to set the target Ruby
  version for a test.
- Configuration: `let(:cop_config) { { 'EnforcedStyle' => 'bar' } }`.

## Changelog Entries

Every user-visible change needs a changelog entry:

```bash
bundle exec rake changelog:fix    # Bug fix
bundle exec rake changelog:new    # New feature
bundle exec rake changelog:change # Changed behavior
```

Commit first; the task derives the entry's text from the last commit title.

Format (single line):

```
* [#123](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/issues/123): Description. ([@username][])
```

- Must end with `([@username][])`.
- `spec/project_spec.rb` validates the format in CI.
- Skip the changelog only for purely internal changes (refactors with no
  user-visible effect).
- Generate the entry after committing the change, then amend it into that commit.
  `rake changelog:*` names the file after the last commit subject, so committing first
  gives the entry the right filename.

## PR and Commit Conventions

- Prefix commit messages with `[Fix #N]` when an issue exists.
- Each distinct fix belongs in its own logical commit. When a PR bundles several
  unrelated fixes (e.g. multiple cops, multiple false positives), give each one a
  separate commit with its own changelog entry rather than squashing them all
  into a single commit. Squash only commits that are part of the *same* fix.
- A changelog entry belongs in the same commit as the change it describes.
  Never add a changelog-only commit, including a follow-up that just fills in
  the PR number. Amend the entry into the commit it belongs to instead.
- Never add AI attribution to a commit or a PR description: no `Co-authored-by`
  or `Assisted-by` trailers naming a tool or model, and no "generated with"
  footers. CONTRIBUTING.md asks the same of human contributors.
- Run `bundle exec rake` and ensure it passes before pushing.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing `alias on_csend on_send`** — cops that check `on_send` must also
   handle safe navigation unless explicitly inapplicable.
2. **Missing `alias on_numblock on_block` / `alias on_itblock on_block`** —
   cops that check `on_block` must also handle numbered-parameter and
   `it`-parameter block forms.
3. **Invalid Ruby in YARD examples** — the CI `documentation_syntax_check` task
   parses every `@example` block. Use only valid syntax.
4. **Cop description not a sentence** — must start with a verb and end with a
   period (e.g. `# Checks for ...`, not `# Check for ...`).
5. **Missing `RESTRICT_ON_SEND`** — always define this when using `on_send`.
6. **Missing `@!method` YARD tag** — every `def_node_matcher` /
   `def_node_search` needs a `@!method` tag above it.
7. **Forgetting changelog entry** — CI will flag it.
8. **Manually creating changelog files** — use the rake tasks instead to get
   the correct filename format.
9. **Missing `extend AutoCorrector`** — required if the cop provides a
   `corrector` block in `add_offense`.
10. **Not running full `bundle exec rake`** — partial test runs miss lint and
    doc-syntax failures.
11. **Hardcoding node types instead of using node pattern matchers** — prefer
    `def_node_matcher` over manual `node.type == :send` checks.
12. **Not testing both `send` and `csend`** — if you alias `on_csend`, write
    specs that cover the `&.` operator.
13. **Spec stubs inheriting from `RuboCop::Cop::Cop`**: inheriting from the
    deprecated class emits a warning, and CI runs specs with
    `STRICT_WARNINGS=1`, which turns it into a failure you won't see locally.
    Stub cops with `stub_cop_class` on `Base`, and read their offenses from
    `cop.send(:complete_investigation).offenses`; `Base#offenses` raises by
    design.
14. **Using `--only` to test whether a cop is enabled**: `--only` forces the
    named cop on regardless of `Enabled`, `pending` or preview. To test
    enablement, run without it and count the cop's offenses in the output.
15. **Committing regenerated cop docs**: `rake update_cops_documentation`
    rewrites `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/cops_*.adoc` and picks up drift from
    every cop merged since the last release. Those files are regenerated at
    release time; don't include them in a PR.
16. **Guessing Antora anchors**: cross-page `xref` anchors in the manual are
    the heading lowercased with everything but letters removed
    (`#allowmultilinefinalelement`), not Asciidoctor's `_`-prefixed default.
    When in doubt, put an explicit `[#my-anchor]` above the heading.
17. **Removing a range that holds comments or heredoc bodies**: a correction
    that deletes everything between two tokens also drops any comment,
    directive or heredoc body in between. Shrink the range so they stay, or skip
    the correction when one is there.
18. **Assuming every call looks like `recv.meth args`**: `super` and `yield`
    have a keyword instead of a selector (use `Util.args_begin`), and index,
    setter and operator calls (`foo[x]`, `foo.bar = x`, `a == b`) can't just
    have their arguments wrapped in parentheses (check `setter_method?` and
    `operator_method?`). Inserting an expression may need
    parentheses too: a hash literal as the first argument of a call without
    parentheses is read as a block.
19. **Line-based corrections on shared lines**: a correction that moves or
    deletes whole lines breaks when the node shares its line with other code
    (`a; b`, or a one-line `if ... then ... else ... end`). Check that the node
    begins and ends its lines. If a correct correction is hard for such a rare
    shape, register the offense without correcting it (`expect_no_corrections`
    in the spec) rather than produce broken code.
20. **Indexing the wrong source with node offsets**: `processed_source.raw_source`
    keeps `\r\n` line endings, while node positions index
    `processed_source.buffer.source`, which normalizes them. Likewise, a string
    node's `value` differs from its source whenever it has escapes, so offsets
    into one don't map onto the other.
21. **Walking past a disabled node**: a correction that merges or moves
    neighboring nodes has to stop at a node whose offense is disabled by a
    directive (`enabled_lines?`), because that node keeps its source.
22. **Declaring `autocorrect_incompatible_with` on both cops**: one side is
    enough. When either cop of the pair has been applied, the team holds back
    the other's corrections until the next pass.
23. **Rescuing `Errno::EACCES` without `Errno::EPERM`**: sandboxes that only
    allow the project directory, like the ones coding agents run in, fail
    filesystem calls with `EPERM`.
