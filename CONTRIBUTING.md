# Contributing

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please report them to the [issue tracker][1] of the repository or
submit a pull request. Please, try to follow these guidelines when you
do so.

## Issue reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code
  (a.k.a. `master`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.
* Include the output of `rubocop -V`:

```
$ rubocop -V
0.16.0 (using Parser 2.1.2, running on ruby 2.0.0 x86_64-darwin12.4.0)
```

* Include any relevant code to the issue summary.

## Creating Cops

### Create the cop files

1) Create your cop in `./lib/rubocop/cop/{type}/{name}.rb`
2) Require your cop in `./lib/rubocop.rb`
3) Your test should be created at `./spec/rubocop/cop/{type}/{name}_spec.rb`
4) Add your rule to either the `config/disabled.yml` or `config/enabled.yml` file depending on if it should be enabled by default or not. Cops that are not based on style guide rules should be disabled (normally) by default.

### Finding your offenses

#### Investigate

The [investigate method](lib/rubocop/cop/style/semicolon.rb#L11) gets passed a [processed source](lib/rubocop/processed_source.rb). This object can be asked questions about the source, retrieve all of the source tokens and get specific lines as strings.

#### On specific nodes

Special methods get triggered, if they exist, for individual nodes. You can target a specific node to get to a single method using this. Defining a method `on_class`, for example, would get triggered everytime a class node is found in the source, and that node is passed in.

A [list of node types](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/blob/master/lib/parser/meta.rb) are available at the [parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser) repo.

#### Variable Force

Yeah, I got nothing. What's this do?

### Auto Correct

Rubocop allows you to auto correct code based on your rules. You add a lambda to an array of `corrections`, which then get processed. Your lambda will be passed a [corrector](lib/rubocop/cop/corrector.rb) instance, and has access to the node that was passed into the main `autocorrect` method.

### Tests

~~~ bash
$ rake && rubocop
~~~

## Pull requests

* Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on Github][2].
* Fork the project.
* Use a topic/feature branch to easily amend a pull request later, if necessary.
* Write [good commit messages][3].
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Add an entry to the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) accordingly. See [changelog entry format](#changelog-entry-format).
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If
  you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that
  is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick
  around it.
* Make sure the test suite is passing ([including rbx and jruby][7]) and the code you wrote doesn't produce
  RuboCop offenses.
* [Squash related commits together][5].
* Open a [pull request][4] that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.

### Changelog entry format

Here are a few examples:

```
* [#716](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/716): Fixed a regression in the auto-correction logic of `MethodDefParentheses`. ([@bbatsov][])
* New cop `ElseLayout` checks for odd arrangement of code in the `else` branch of a conditional expression. ([@bbatsov][])
```

* Mark it up in [Markdown syntax][6].
* The entry line should start with `* ` (an asterisk and a space).
* If the change has a related GitHub issue (e.g. a bug fix for a reported issue), put a link to the issue as `[#123](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/123): `.
* Describe the brief of the change. The sentence should end with a punctuation.
* At the end of the entry, add an implicit link to your GitHub user page as `([@username][])`.
* If this is your first contribution to RuboCop project, add a link definition for the implicit link to the bottom of the changelog as `[@username]: https://github.com/username`.
