      # Checks for probable typos in constant and method names: a name that
      # does not resolve anywhere in the project, used in a namespace the
      # project does define, with a close-named sibling to suggest instead.
      #
      # The check is powered by the project-wide index, so it only runs when
      # `AllCops/UseProjectIndex` is enabled and the `rubydex` gem is installed.
      # Without the index the cop does nothing.
      #
      # Constants are checked only in qualified references (`Foo::Bar`) whose
      # namespace resolves in the index; bare names cannot be distinguished
      # from constants provided by gems or the standard library. Methods are
      # checked only in calls on constant receivers (`Foo.bar`) whose entire
      # indexed ancestry is resolved, so methods gained through gem classes or
      # dynamic definitions never produce offenses. In both cases an offense
      # requires a similarly named alternative to exist — an unknown name
      # alone is not reported, since the index does not see gems or the
      # standard library.
      #
      # For the same reason, a namespace whose root segment names a gem in the
      # bundle (`Flipper` for the `flipper` gem) is left alone: a project that
      # reopens it (`module Flipper; module Adapters; ...`) makes it resolve in
      # the index, while the members the gem itself defines stay invisible and
      # would look like typos. Enabling `AllCops/ProjectIndexIncludesGems`
      # indexes those sources and restores the check.
      #
      # Names that appear as symbols or inside string literals in the same
      # file are never reported, since they usually belong to runtime
      # definitions the index cannot see (`stub_const`, `const_set`,
      # `define_method`, and the like).
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad - Services::UserCraetor is not defined, Services::UserCreator is
      #   Services::UserCraetor.new
      #
      #   # good
      #   Services::UserCreator.new
      #
      #   # bad - Report.generate_sumary is not defined, Report.generate_summary is
      #   Report.generate_sumary
      #
      #   # good
      #   Report.generate_summary
      #
      # @example CheckConstants: false
      #   # good - constant references are not checked
      #   Services::UserCraetor.new
      #
      # @example CheckMethods: false
      #   # good - method calls are not checked
      #   Report.generate_sumary
      #
      # @example AllowedNames: ['generate_sumary']
      #   # good - the name is explicitly allowed
