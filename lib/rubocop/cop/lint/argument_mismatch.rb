      # Checks for calls that pass the wrong number of positional arguments to a
      # method whose definition is known from the project index.
      #
      # The check is powered by the project-wide index, so it only runs when
      # `AllCops/UseProjectIndex` is enabled and the `rubydex` gem is installed.
      # Without the index the cop does nothing.
      #
      # Only calls on constant receivers (`Foo.bar`) are considered, and only
      # when the receiver resolves in the index, its entire ancestry is resolved
      # (so a method inherited from a gem or the standard library never produces
      # an offense), and the called method resolves to a single, unambiguous
      # signature. Calls that forward arguments (`*`, `**`, `...`) are skipped
      # because their argument count is not statically known. Keyword arguments
      # passed to a method that declares no keyword parameters are counted as the
      # single positional hash they collapse into, matching Ruby's semantics.
      #
      # Constructor calls (`Foo.new`) and keyword-argument validation are out of
      # scope: only positional arity of explicitly defined singleton methods is
      # checked. `new` is skipped outright, because `Class#new` is not in the
      # index: any `new` the index does find sits below it in the method
      # resolution order, where Ruby would never reach it.
      #
      # @example
      #   # Given the project defines:
      #   #   class Report
      #   #     def self.generate(source, format); end
      #   #   end
      #
      #   # bad
      #   Report.generate(source)
      #
      #   # bad
      #   Report.generate(source, :pdf, :extra)
      #
      #   # good
      #   Report.generate(source, :pdf)
